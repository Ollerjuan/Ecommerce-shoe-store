# Full eCommerce Web
# Project discription
I created an ecommerce website specifically for shoes! Users have to login in first using a 3rd party sign in app (Auth0) where the profile and user name will populate in the navbar. Once user is logged in, they will be able to see the shoes that have been posted and stored via mongo database. 

# MVP Goals
- user will be able to add products to cart 
- user will be able to delete products 
- user will be able to post products
